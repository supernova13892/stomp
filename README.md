# Changes

This fork was done solely to support retries/failure support for Laravel queues when using the **php-enqueue/stomp** package. After no responses from the dev on the issue created in its official repo, I decided to work on it here.

# Note

Only tested(and possibly only works) for ActiveMQ. The header passed for delay is ActiveMQ specific.
